# UbiJam2020
Repo for the Game Jam organize by Ubisoft, 27-29.11.20

# Theme: Essentials
You're blocked at home because of the pandemic, and your neighbors need some random essential stuffs (TP, TV Remote, the cat, ...). The best way you found to provide them the things they need and keeping the social distancing is to throw those stuffs to them using a big ass slingshot.
Only issue is, you're kind of dumb, and you can't remember where you put those items. So you need to go around the apartment, look into the furniture (exclamation point appearing), and click on the mouse/space bar to fetch the item that's hidden in there.


# CONTROLS
## Character:
* WASD / Arrows to move
* Left Click / Space bar to grab/release Item
* Shit to run
* Tab to Pause game (buggy, you need to stay press on the button)

## Slingshot:
* WASD / Arrows to move
* Left Click / Space bar to Fire
* Q/E to move target up or down
* Tab to Pause game (buggy, you need to stay press on the button)

# Release
Check out the release 1.4 in the release page, this is the best one we did. The 1.3 was the one we presented on the itch.io page though, but the slingshot isn't working properly in there.
